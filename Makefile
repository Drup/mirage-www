# MODE: unix for Unix executable, xen for Xen unikernel
MODE   ?= unix
# FS: crunch for in-memory read-only store, fat for read-write filesystem
FS     ?= crunch
# NET: direct for mirage network stack, socket for unix sockets (Unix mode only)
NET    ?= direct
# XENIMG: the name to provide for the xen image and configuration
XENIMG ?= www
# HOST: all links will be relative to this domain; default is localhost
HOST   ?= localhost

# to configure the network via DHCP:
# DHCP = true

# to configure the network statically with ip 10.0.0.2/24 and gateway 10.0.0.1:
# IP = "10.0.0.2"
# NETMASK = "255.255.255.0"
# GATEWAYS = "10.0.0.1"
#
# if none of DHCP || (IP && NETMASK && GATEWAYS) is set,
# default static settings will be used.

# to serve pages over https:
# TLS = true
# to make it work with FS=crunch, put the certificate in tls/tls/server.key and the private key in tls/tls/server.pem

# to redirect all http requests to https://somewhereelse.org:
# REDIRECT = https://somewhereelse.org
# (redirect must be an http:// or https:// url)
# if TLS is set but REDIRECT is not, the value of REDIRECT will be assumed to be https://$HOST , with the effect that all http requests will be redirected to https
